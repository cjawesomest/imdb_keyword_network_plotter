# IMDB Performer Network Plotter

Scrapes the Internet Movie DataBase (IMDB) for media content created under a particular searchterm. After scraping for performers from each movie, show, flick, etc, a plot is generated connecting each performer to each other if they share a common production. 

## Initial Results 2020
Plots showcases snapshots of the IMDB taken for a variety of keywords as of March 11th, 2020.
* Plots showcase a network of performers, with connections made between them if they are both present in a single production.
* Each performer (node) is colored based on how many productions that they have appeared in.
* Clustering coefficients show the degree to which all of the nodes of the graph are interconnected. A single node's clustering coefficient is calculated by dividing the number of edges from that node by the total number of nodes.
